### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
      <div class="card__suvs">
        <div class="suvs-icon">
          <img src="images/icon-suvs.svg" alt="icono suvs">
        </div>
        <p class="card__header-suvs">SUVs</p>
        <p>
          Take an SUV for its spacious 
          interior, power, and versatility. Perfect for your 
          next family vacation 
          and off-road adventures.
        </p>
        <p class="button__suvs button">Learn More</p>
      </div>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  .container{
    width: auto;
    height: 150rem;
    border-radius: 5rem;
    display: grid;
